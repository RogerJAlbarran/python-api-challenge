# Python and API's
Created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator
WeatherPy

I built a scatter plot to show these relationships

Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
